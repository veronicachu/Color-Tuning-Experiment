### Overview:
Experimental framework for a feature-based attention study using visual search to ensure attention to color. Three different stimuli hue values can be set by the experimenter in DKL color space; lookup table values from monitor spectrophotometer measurements must be added as csv files. During an initial calibration phase of the experiment, subjects can adjust luminance and saturation values of central stimuli colors. The each experiment trial presents multiple visual search arrays containing 3 colors (1 target color and 2 distractor colors). Subjects count the number of target appearances within the trial and enters the counted number in an input box at the end of the trial. While subjects attend to the central visual search task, the peripheral flickers various colors trial-to-trial to probe at the subject's attentional color filter using measurements of SSVEP responses.
